## Using this API call, you will be able to fetch Historical weather data for any location in the world. 
### In the example, I have used it to extract data for New Delhi for the duration of a year. 

The data is being pulled using the Meteostat Python library. 

The Meteostat Python library provides a simple API for accessing open weather and climate data. 
The historical observations and statistics are collected by Meteostat from different public interfaces, most of which are governmental.
